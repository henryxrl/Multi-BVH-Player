This ([URL](https://henryxrl.github.io/Multi-BVH-Player/Multi-BVH%20Player%20Long%20Dance.html)) is a separated Multi-BVH Player that's suitable for viewing long animations with annoated transition frames. A transition text file (0 or 1 per line, indicating whether a transition exists on a per-frame basis) is needed.

Implemented based on [olympe](http://lo-th.github.io/olympe/)'s [BVH Player](http://lo-th.github.io/olympe/BVH_player.html)

Support for up to 3 BVH animations simultaneously. All actions (play, pause, camera rotation, etc.) are synchronized across all animations.
